- From all these information i crafted the flag that look likes this.

```0CTF{New_York_Fashion_Week_2018_Cardi_Minaj}```

- But this flag got rejected and then i contacted the support team raising the ticket and honestly they were very responsive and try their best to reply as soon as possible.

- I got this reply from them.
